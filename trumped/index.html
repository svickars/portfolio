              Known for his strong interjections and his 140-character feuds with everyone from Rosie O&rsquo;Donnell to Mac Miller, the now-president always makes the most of his quickly typed messages and his 32.7 million followers, a following which,
              as the
              <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/04/28/us/politics/donald-trump-twitter-100-days-of-tweets.html?action=click&contentCollection=Politics&module=RelatedCoverage&region=EndOfArticle&pgtype=article">New York Times</a> pointed
              out, is 1.7 times larger than that of the official <a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS">@POTUS</a> twitter.</p>
            <p>In April, both the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/04/28/the-first-100-days-of-president-realdonaldtrump/?utm_term=.0ed263cb8cd5">Washington Post</a> and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/04/28/us/politics/donald-trump-twitter-100-days-of-tweets.html?action=click&contentCollection=Politics&module=RelatedCoverage&region=EndOfArticle&pgtype=article">New York Times</a>              dove into the President&rsquo;s tweets over his first 100 days, cataloging and categorizing each, tracking his retweets, emojis, and busiest times, and discussing his repeated yells of &ldquo;FAKE NEWS!&rdquo; But I wanted to dive a little
              deeper into the <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump">@realDonaldTrump</a>&rsquo;s tweets, chirps, and occasional misfires over his first 100 days in office.</p>
            <p>This essay visualizes all <strong>501</strong> Trump tweets between January 20<sup>th</sup> and April 29<sup>th</sup> to find out what he was saying, how he was saying it, and when he was talking about it. We'll also look at the source of
              his messages and the tw-entiment (ha, get it?). It works best on Chrome on your desktop, but I won't fault you for scrolling through it on your mobile. We're going to look at this from plenty of different angles, and as such, this essay
              isn't meant as a full exploration of each, but rather a short and sweet investigation to serve as a jumping off point for a couple of future projects. Full credits are at the end of the article, but I make use of data from the <a href="http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/archive">Trump Twitter Archive</a>.</p>

            <h5>Topics</h5>
            <p>In the <strong>100</strong> days following his inauguration, <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump">@realDonaldTrump</a> tweeted exactly <strong>50</strong> times about the <span class="inline-legend legend-media">media</span>, <strong>46</strong>              times about <span class="inline-legend legend-foreignAffairs">foreign affairs</span>,

            <p>He also posted about his <span class="inline-legend legend-immigrationBan">immigration ban</span> and <span class="inline-legend legend-makingAmericaGreatAgain">Making America Great Again</span> (33 times each), <span class="inline-legend legend-healthcare">healthcare</span>              and <span class="inline-legend legend-unofficialBusiness">unofficial business</span> (28 times each), the <span class="inline-legend legend-democraticParty">democratic party</span> (27), <span class="inline-legend legend-foreignLeader">foreign leaders</span>              (24), <span class="inline-legend legend-russia">Russia</span> (20), the <span class="inline-legend legend-election">2016 election</span> (12), his own <span class="inline-legend legend-republicanParty">republican party</span> (11), and of

            <h5>Popular Words</h5>
            <p>The President liked to mention his own name. In fact, in a tie with <span class="inline-legend legend-white">media</span>, he mentioned <span class="inline-legend legend-white">Trump</span> <strong>27</strong> times. Together, they account
              for just about 1% all the words he posted on Twitter (including emoji and hashtags). He also likes the words <span class="inline-legend legend-white">People</span> (26), <span class="inline-legend legend-white">President</span> (25),
              <span class="inline-legend legend-white">me</span> (24), <span class="inline-legend legend-white">Whitehouse</span> (23), <span class="inline-legend legend-white">Great</span> (23), <span class="inline-legend legend-white">FAKE</span> (22),
              <span class="inline-legend legend-white">America</span> (21), and <span class="inline-legend legend-white">Election</span> (21) (let it go!).</p>

            <h5>Sentiment</h5>
            <p>You know the saying, &ldquo;never tweet angry?&rdquo; Well, neither do I, but it's still a good idea. And it's a truth that is perhaps most important for the leader of the free world. Donald Trump&rsquo;s angriest (read most negative) tweets
              were presumably seen by well over the 32.7 million people who follow him &mdash; and there were a few of these tweets. For this &ldquo;twentiment&rdquo; analysis I ran each tweet through a natural language processor in Python to determine
              it's score on the polarity scale, with -1 being the most negative and +1 being the most positive. The tweets in the background are coloured according to this scale, with the angriest being darker and the happiest lighter.</p>
            <p>In general, and unsurprisingly, the more strongly a tweet aligned to one end of the spectrum or the other, the more subjective &mdash; or, the more influenced by his personal feelings &mdash; his message was.</p>

            <h5>Grammar</h5>
            <p>To borrow a line from Polly Higgins of AM New York, Donald Trump may not be a &ldquo;polished politician,&rdquo; but he is a longtime English speaker. This fact, however, is far from obvious when we look at his Twitter account. The background
              now is showing all 9000 words he's tweeted since January 20<sup>th</sup>, coloured by their part of speech (or POS). While it's been pointed out many times that his grammar and spelling are less than impeccable, he seems to have cleaned
              it up a bit since becoming President, and unfortunately, we're only looking at his tweets in a very specific timespan, so those will have to wait.</p>

          <h2>Work hard, tweet hard?</h2>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 50px">This chart shows the distribution of Trump's tweets over his first 100 days, coloured by the main topic. Below his tweets are significant events that happened during his first 100 days, from his inauguration to his immigration ban to his order
            to investigate steel imports. Go ahead and click on a tweet to take a look, filter by category, or hover over an event to see more.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="s2-textbox">
          <p id="s2-day1">His first tweet, coming mere hours before his inaugural address, was on his first day in office. It was followed by 500 more, coming in fairly consistently over his first 100 days. He tweeted just about once per day from January 20<sup>th</sup>            through Aril 29<sup>th</sup></p>
        </div>
        <div class="s2-textbox">
          <p id="s2-day100">The last tweet of his first 100 days was posted on 9 pm on his final day, in reply to a comment made by Fox Business Network anchor Lou Dobbs. In the time between his first and last tweet, he only missed one day of tweeting. From 5:46 pm on
            April 14
            <sup>th</sup> until 9:41 am two days later &mdash; exactly one day, 15 hours, and 55 minutes,&mdash; @realDonaldTrump was Twitter silent, a rare occurrence for the high-profile celebrity.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="s2-textbox">
          <p id="s2-percent10">The first 10% of his tweets were sent in the first week of his presidency. That's 50 tweets in 7 days.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="s2-textbox">
          <p id="s2-percent25">A quarter of them was posted by the 20-day mark. That's 125 in less than three weeks, a rate of 6.25 tweets <em>per day</em>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="s2-textbox">
          <p id="s2-percent75">By the 75-day mark, he had slowed down to about five tweets per day, or 375 total.</p>

        <div class="s2-textbox" style="margin-top: 250px;">
          <h2>Some key tweets</h2>
          <p>Comparing the timing of some major events with the timing of some popular tweets, we can make a connection between the two. It seems that Trump often takes to Twitter to back himself up, defend himself, vent his frustrations, or maybe just to
            get some attention.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="s2-textbox">
          <p id="s2-keytweet1">The day after Donald Trump was sworn in as President, millions of people took to the streets all over the world &mdash; some 500,000 in D.C. alone &mdash; as part of the International Women's March. The Donald promptly took to Twitter, scorning
            the protesters and asking why the didn't vote, only to follow it up with a much calmer <a id="s2-keytweet15">tweet, this time expressing his appreciation for their right to march.</a></p>
        </div>
        <div class="s2-textbox">
          <p id="s2-keytweet2">A week later, a raid was launched against Al-Qaeda in Yemen, a risky and costly mission that led to the death of one American and a number of civilian casualties. The event was discussed at length by the media, and seemingly in response, Trump
            sent out a tweet saying we cannot allow the horrors in the Middle East to continue.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="s2-textbox">
          <p id="s2-keytweet3">Only three days later, it was reported that Trump had a heated phone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull about the refugee resettlement deal. Immediately following the conversation, he sent out the following: &ldquo;Call
            it what you want, it is about keeping bad people (with bad intentions) out of country!&rdquo;</p>
        </div>
        <div class="s2-textbox">
          <p id="s2-keytweet4">Later that week, we saw a series of messages, posted following the temporary block of Trump&rsquo;s immigration ban by a judge in the district court of Western Washington. Trump went on to question the <a id="s2-keytweet45">&ldquo;so-called&rdquo; judge&rsquo;s qualifications</a>            and <a id="s2-keytweet46">call it a &ldquo;terrible decision.&rdquo;</a></p>
        </div>
        <div class="s2-textbox">
          <p id="s2-keytweet5">Skipping ahead to the final week of his first 100 days, Trump sends out beautifully-composed and wonderfully-timed tweet discussing/defending his first-100-days accomplishments.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="s2-textbox" id="timings" style="margin-top: 250px;">
          <h2>No rest for the wicked?</h2>
          <p>It turns out Donald Trump&rsquo;s a pretty early riser (as perhaps Presidents should be). He regularly tweets around the 6 am mark, and occasionally tweets late into the night. Interestingly, there are a few trends when it comes to two things:
            one, what he's tweeting about, and two, what device he&rsquo;s using. Take a look...</p>
        </div>

        <div class="s2-textbox" id="timings-election">
          <p>As noted above, he tweeted about the 2016 election twelve times in his first 100 days, and eleven of those tweets came in the AM. 5 of those came from an Android device, which many believe is his personal mobile.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="s2-textbox" id="timings-muslimban">
          <p>Whether it was to defend it, promote it, or complain about judges being unfair, when it comes to his immigration ban, Trump took to Twitter <em>a lot</em>. 33 times in his first 100 days to be exact. And only five of the 33 came after February
            21
            <sup>st</sup>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="s2-textbox" id="timings-fakenews">
          <p>As was the case with the 2016 election, Trump generally tweeted about what he dubbed #FakeNews in the mornings. And up until March 15<sup>th</sup>, generally on his personal Android device.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="s2-textbox" id="sources" style="margin-top: 250px;">
          <h2>iPhone vs Android</h2>
          <p>@realDonaldTrump&rsquo;s account tweets from two different devices. One is an iPhone and one an Android, and as many have pointed out before me, it's often obvious which one is the real Donald. <a href="http://varianceexplained.org/r/trump-tweets/">David Robinson</a>            did a comprehensive language analysis, confirming that Trump's angrier tweets, AKA his Android tweets, are coming from the real him.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="s2-textbox" id="endS2" style="margin-top: 250px;">
          <p>Highlighted now are the 167 tweets sent from his Android device, all but one of which were posted before March 8<sup>th</sup>. Click through the filters above the graph to see some trends in particular topics when it comes to what device he's
            tweeting from, and we'll see, it's <em>almost</em> as though someone took his Android away.</p>
